# software

The main python `dual_task_pattern-n-back` is at the core of the study code. It runs a predefined 2-back sequence, controls the muscle stimulation, and logs all data into `.csv` files. The script also communicates with Unity3D via OSC to start/stop logging positional data from the Vive tracker. 

The Unity3D project is installed by creating a new project and importing the `study_nback.unitypackage`. This project logs the Vive tracker raw data.

More information about the study procedure can be found in the paper.
